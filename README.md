ios-code-convention
===================

These guidelines build on Apple's existing [Coding Guidelines for Cocoa](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CodingGuidelines/CodingGuidelines.html).
Unless explicitly contradicted below, assume that all of Apple's guidelines apply as well.

## Whitespace

 * Tabs, not spaces.
 * End files with a newline.
 * Make liberal use of vertical whitespace to divide code into logical chunks.

## Documentation and Organization

 * All method declarations should be documented.
 * Comments should be hard-wrapped at 80 characters.
 * Comments should be [AppleDoc](http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/)-style.
 * Document whether object parameters allow `nil` as a value.
 * Use `#pragma mark`s to categorize methods into functional groupings and protocol implementations, following this general structure:

```objc

- (void)setCustomProperty:(id)value {}

#pragma mark -
#pragma mark Lifecycle

+ (id)objectWithThing:(id)thing {}
- (id)init {}

#pragma mark -
#pragma mark Drawing

- (void)drawRect:(CGRect) {}

#pragma mark -
#pragma mark Another functional grouping

#pragma mark -
#pragma mark NSSuperclass

- (void)someOverriddenMethod {}

#pragma mark -
#pragma mark NSCopying

- (id)copyWithZone:(NSZone *)zone {}

#pragma mark -
#pragma mark NSObject

- (NSString *)description {}
```

## Declarations
 * Always declare memory-management semantics even on `readonly` properties.
 * Declare properties `readonly` if they are only set once in `-init`.
 * Don't use `@synthesize` unless the compiler requires it. Note that optional properties in protocols must be explicitly synthesized in order to exist.
 * Declare properties `copy` if they return immutable objects and aren't ever mutated in the implementation. `strong` should only be used when exposing a mutable object, or an object that does not conform to `<NSCopying>`.
 * Instance variables should be prefixed with an underscore (just like when implicitly synthesized).
 * Don't put a space between an object type and the protocol it conforms to.
 
```objc
@property (attributes) id<Protocol> object;
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSObject<Protocol> *object;
```
 
 * C function declarations should have no space before the opening parenthesis, and should be namespaced just like a class.

```objc
void NSAwesomeFunction(BOOL hasSomeArgs);
```

 * Constructors should generally return [`instancetype`](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/LanguageExtensions.html#related-result-types) rather than `id`.
 * Prefer C99 struct initialiser syntax to helper functions (such as `CGRectMake()`).

```objc
  CGRect rect = { .origin.x = 3.0, .origin.y = 12.0, .size.width = 15.0, .size.height = 80.0 };
   ```

## Expressions

 * Don't access an ivar unless you're in `-init`, `-dealloc` or a custom accessor.
 * Use dot-syntax when invoking idempotent methods, including setters.
 * Use object literals, boxed expressions, and subscripting over the older, grosser alternatives.
 * Comparisons should be explicit for everything except `BOOL`s.
 * Prefer positive comparisons to negative.
 * Never use more than one ternary operator in single line
 * Long form ternary operators should be wrapped in parentheses and only used for assignment and arguments.

```objc
Blah *a = (stuff == thing ? foo : bar);
```

* Short form, `nil` coalescing ternary operators should avoid parentheses.

```objc
Blah *b = thingThatCouldBeNil ?: defaultValue;
```

 * Separate binary operands with a single space, but unary operands and casts with none:

```c
void *ptr = &value + 10 * 3;
NewType a = (NewType)b;

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    doCoolThings();
}
```

## Control Structures

 * Always surround `if` bodies with curly braces if there is an `else`. Single-line `if` bodies without an `else` should be on the same line as the `if`. 
 * All curly braces should begin on the same line as their associated statement. They should end on a new line.
 * Put a single space after keywords and before their parentheses.
 * Return and break early.
 * Else statement in `if else` block should be always on separate line

```objc
if (somethingIsBad) return;

if (something == nil) {
	// do stuff
} 
else {
	// do other stuff
}
```

## Exceptions and Error Handling

 * Don't use exceptions for flow control.
 * Use exceptions only to indicate programmer error.
 * To indicate errors, use an `NSError **` argument or use `NSError` as return value as suggested by [Apple](http://developer.apple.com).

## Blocks

 * Blocks should have a space between their return type and name.
 * Block definitions should omit their return type when possible.
 * Block definitions should omit their arguments if they are `void`.
 * Parameters in block types should be named unless the block is initialized immediately.

```objc
void (^blockName1)(void) = ^{
    // do some things
};

id (^blockName2)(id) = ^ id (id args) {
    // do some things
};
```

## Literals

 * Avoid making numbers a specific type unless necessary (for example, prefer `5` to `5.0`, and `5.3` to `5.3f`).
 * The contents of array and dictionary literals should not have a space on both sides.
 * Dictionary literals should have a single space between the key and the colon, and a single space between colon and value.

``` objc
NSArray *theStuff = @[@1, @2, @3];

NSDictionary *keyedStuff = @{NSDidCreateStyleGuide : @YES};
```

 * Longer or more complex literals should be split over multiple lines (optionally with a terminating comma):

``` objc
NSArray *theStuff = @[
    @"Got some long string objects in here.",
    [AndSomeModelObjects too],
    @"Moar strings."
];

NSDictionary *keyedStuff = @{
    @"this.key": @"corresponds to this value",
    @"otherKey": @"remoteData.payload",
    @"some": @"more",
    @"JSON": @"keys",
    @"and": @"stuff",
};
```

## Categories

 * Categories should be named for the sort of functionality they provide. Don't create umbrella categories.
 * If you need to expose private methods for subclasses or unit testing, create a class extension named `Class+Private`.
